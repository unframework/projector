title: Why Build From Scratch?
---

Front-end Web dev is getting complicated. Many frameworks to learn, a lot of opinion to consider.

Typically, folks learn a toolchain through the "do X in order to get Y" pattern. Incremental, recipe-driven steps; bang it with a wrench until it works. This is especially true for front-end code: there are a lot of tutorials on *how* to do things, but not about *why*.

One of the best ways to learn to do something is to start all the way back at a blank slate and build up from there. See [http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/), for example. This is not about [NIH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) or saddling teammates and clients with unproven new code, but retracing the steps that led to existing frameworks and tools, as a learning exercise.

To learn and understand front-end frameworks like AngularJS and ReactJS, we will reinvent them from the ground up.
